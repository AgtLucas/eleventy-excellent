This is a very opinated starter, but it can be further developed in many directions. In its current form, it can already be used as a simple blog. To avoid overloading this base with too many subtleties, I put special features such as image gallery, internationalisation, pagination etc. in branches that keep up with the main branch.

## Demos

{% for item in demos %}

   <h3>{{ item.title }}</h3>
   <p>{{ item.description }} <br /><a href="{{ item.preview }}">Demo</a> / <a href="{{ item.branch }}">Branch</a></p>

{% endfor %}
